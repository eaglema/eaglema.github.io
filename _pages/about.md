I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Robotics & Automation at Nanjing University. From 2022 to 2025, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I worked with Prof. Richard Braatz. Prior to that, I earned my PhD in 2022 from The University of Manchester under the supervision of Dr. Jie Li.

My research interest lies at the intersection of learning, optimization, and control, with applications in chemical and biological processes as well as robotics. Specifically, my interests include:
- Nonlinear and nonconvex optimization, including nonlinear programming, dynamic optimization, and mixed-integer nonlinear programming
- Model predictive control, particularly nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)
- Machine learning (AI for science)
- Optimization and control under uncertainty
- Applying advanced algorithms and theory to real-world problems in chemical/biological systems and robotics
