# About me

I am **Yingjie Ma**, an Assistant Professor in the School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering at Nanjing University.  
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT working with Prof. Richard Braatz on advanced optimization, nonlinear control, and uncertainty quantification for biomanufacturing.

My research interests include:
- Nonlinear & nonconvex optimization (NLP, MINLP)
- Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
- Multiscale bioprocess modeling and uncertainty quantification
- Software development for process systems engineering (e.g., GlycoPy, IFOPT)
